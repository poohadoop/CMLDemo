# Credit Card Fraud Detection

![MacDown logo](resources/creditcard.png)

## Introduction

This is a demo project to showcase the features of the Cloudera Data Science
Workbench.

The data used in this project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/version/3)

â€œThe datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. 
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have **492 frauds out of 284,807** transactions. 

The project consists of 5 parts:
* Part 1: Importing Data                  `1_create_data.py` 
* Part 2: Data Analysis and Visualization `2_data_analysis.py`
* Part 3: Model Training                  `3_train_modelpy`
* Part 4: Model Deployment                `4_deploy_model.py`
* Part 5: Model Tuning                    `5_check_model.py`

_Note: The data needs to be copied to the cluster first as per the file_ `setup.sh` _in order for this project to 
work properly_ 

## 1: Importing Data
The data is imported from the cluster and saved to a local dataframe.

## 2: Data Analysis and Visualization
Perform some basic data analysis and visualisation techniques to understand the data better.

## 3: Model Training
Train an ML Model to predict additional values.

## 4: Model Deployment
Deploy the trained model to CDSW to integrate with other internal systems.

## 5: Model Tuning
Adjust the model hyper parameter values using an experiment to optimise the model.

## 6: Model Monitoring via Jobs
Checks the current state of model performance via the Jobs interface

## 7: Model Monitoring via Experiments
Checks the current state of model performance via the Experiments interface

## 8: Model Retraining
Called to retrain the model if there the job in 6 finds the model is below threshold

_Note: For the model deployment, use the following JSON as the example input:_
